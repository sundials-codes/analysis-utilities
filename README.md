# SUNDIALS Analysis Utilities

This repository provides a suite of scipts that can be used to analyze
time integration methods, particularly those included in
[SUNDIALS](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials).  It's initial codes come
from courses taught by Daniel Reynolds at Southern Methodist University,
but additional analysis utilities from others are welcome.

## Organization

Analysis utilities are generally organized by their time integration method
family:

* `RungeKutta` contains utilities for explicit, implicit, and additive
  Runge--Kutta methods.

* `LinearMultistep` contains utilities for explicit and implicit linear
  multistep methods.
